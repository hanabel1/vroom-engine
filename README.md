# vroom-engine

Figma plugin that searches components from publicly available design systems (storybook, code?), and makes a Figma instance out of them.

## Personas

Persona #1: Designers in medium-sized companies that don’t have front-end developers. They want to see how different design systems can be applied to theirs.

Persona #3: We already have an interface but want to borrow existing components since theirs is missing.
Search gives implementation (HTML, React?). This plug in helps search for web implementation and translates it to Figma.


## Problem

Problem: We find components from desgin systems but they DON’T have a Figma file, but we do have HTML/JS and storybook.

## To implement

place and transform a component from design system that doesn’t have a Figma. This way I can play with it immediately with more components inside my own.

CUJ #1: Search → find button → press ‘Place’ through the plugin as a Figma component
